Key Learnings

Browser APIs offer powerful functionality that's often underutilized
Mathematical precision is crucial for smooth user interactions
MDN Documentation is an invaluable resource for discovering new capabilities
Building from scratch provides deeper understanding than using pre-built solutions

Development Approach
This project emphasized learning through hands-on problem-solving rather than following tutorials. Each challenge led to research, experimentation, and ultimately a deeper understanding of web development fundamentals.
